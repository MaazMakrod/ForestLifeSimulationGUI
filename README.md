# ForestLifeSimulationGUI

This is a interactive forest life simulation game that my friend, Ahmad Sheikh, and I have made over 3 week from December 2019 to January 2020. Please take a look at the README file for further instructions.

The LifeSimulationGUI.java is the program and all the other files are the associated images and music, which have been put into a compressed zip folder. I do not own the music and it is "Twist and Shout" by The Beatles. I also do not own the images. They were aquired by my partner and he has used photoshop to edit them to our needs. You will need to download all the files, extract them, and put them in the same folder to run the program. DO NOT change the name of the files.

To play the game you will just have to run the program and select "Simulate". The foxes use the humans as a food source and the humans use the fruit on trees as a food source. To use the interactive features, go to "Tools" select the tool you want from the drop down menu and then select "Select Tool". After that, you select apply.

To use the elements, you will need to selct either the "Marquee Tool" or "Pencil" and then select the element you would like. If the "Marquee Tool" is selected simply drag on the area you would like to see the element applied and then select "Apply". If you select the "Pencil" tool there is no need to select "Apply" and you can just drag your cursor. The selected element will appear where your cursor is dragged.

If you would like to view a video of me using the program instead, please refer to the following Google Drive link:
